### Hi there

I'm a student of **Cybersecurity at Brno University of Technology**, passionate about low-level programming, C/C++, and building efficient, logic-driven applications.  
My projects focus on performance, correctness, and practical useâ€”with minimal dependencies.

**I enjoy working on:**
- Linux/WSL tools in C/C++
- Simulations, logic-based systems, and simple games
- Python/Bash scripting for automation and security tools

**Feel free to watch and use projects in my repositories.**
